  "instruction": "The purpose of this test is to demonstrate the realisation of the computer-based listening comprehension test as it will be arranged spring 2017. Its parts do not form a solid listening comprehension test but instead are a collection of separate individual listening comprehension parts. The function of the buttons and video is what can be expected in spring 2017.\n\nYou may start the audio recordings and the video pertaining to the questions of the listening comprehension test at your own pace, by clicking the corresponding buttons. You are free to decide yourself how much time you spend on reading the questions and answering them. When you have clicked on a button to play a certain audio recording, you can no longer listen to that particular recording again. Do not begin listening before you are ready.<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"attachments/index_files/custom.css\" />",
